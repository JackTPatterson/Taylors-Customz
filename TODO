Hi everyone! My name is Taylor Eggert, I'm from Long Island NY and I am the artist behind your customs. I started my customs business in 2019 during my senior year of high school. I wanted to start customizing because I wanted a pair of my own customs for college and I couldnâ€™t find anyone to design what I had envisioned in my head. So I decided to make them myself. Next thing I knew  I was designing for my friends and friends of friends! I currently am a full-time college student studying business and a student-athlete as well. I love creating new designs on each individual shoe and bringing YOUR ideas to life. There's no design I'm not afraid to try and nothing is impossible! If you have questions please reach out over Instagram or Facebook and I promise to get back to you within the hour! Lastly, I wanted to say thank you for supporting my small business. It has become a passion for me to keep this business going and growing! With all your support you all make my dream and passion possible and I am so grateful for the opportunity to work with you.
